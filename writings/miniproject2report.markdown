## Mini Project 2
The following figure I decided to redesign:

![The dual axis image](F:/linux_windows/onlinecourses/udacity/introductiontodatavisualization/uda-intro-vis/figures/mini1.png " The image to redesign")

Image source [WTF Visualizations](http://viz.wtf/)

### Analysis of the figure

The first observation is that the two arrows outside the axis label is confusing and does not add any information. Second, for showing trends in data line plots are more suitable than bar plots. Third, the use of colors are not made to add  information to visualization thus low data to ink ratio. Fourth, grid lines and tick marks on the y-axis is missing. Finally, labels and titles can be made more informative. 

### Redesign process

First, pencil-paper sketch of the graph.
