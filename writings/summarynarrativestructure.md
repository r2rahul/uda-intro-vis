Below find my attempt on summarizing the narrative structure of the visualization. 

### What is the narrative structure?
By observing the visualization we observe that the visualization does not allow viewers choice of selection in the visualization and presents the data according to author's selection, therefor it is author driven narrative structure.  

### How does the visualization lead you through the data?

The visualization builds by providing evidence and then concluding the main story. In the first part of the visualization the rates of amenable deaths across countries is compared over the time and where US stands up in this comparison is highlighted by using color coding. Next, comparison is done of death rates of diseases types, which can be prevented by timely and proper care among different countries. Finally, the visualization concludes by showing the percentage of people who are without health insurance since 2000 to 2012.  

### What is the story being told?

The main story being highlighted here that what will be the broad social indicators, which will be used to assess the success of expansion of health care or health law. 

### How could this have been improved?

First, a legend for color coding could have significantly improved the interpretation of visualization. Second, there is change in the visualization type, legend or note could have significantly aided the viewers in making transition.
