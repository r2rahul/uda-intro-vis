Below find my attempt on summarizing the narrative structure of the visualization. 

### What is the narrative structure?

### How does the visualization lead you through the data?

### What is the story being told?

### How could this have been improved?

First, color codes are not clear a legend could have significantly improved the interpretation of visualization. Second, there is change in the visualization type, legend or note could have significantly aided the viewers in interpreting the visualization.
