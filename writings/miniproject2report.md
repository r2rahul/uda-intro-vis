## Mini Project 2
The following figure I decided to redesign:

![The dual axis image](../figures/mini1.png " The image to redesign")

Image source [WTF Visualizations](http://viz.wtf/)

### Analysis of the figure

The first observation is that the two arrows outside the axis label is confusing and does not add any information to the visualization. Second, for showing trends in data line plots are more suitable than bar plots. Also, step charts can be used highlight the rise in salary with experience. Third, the use of colors are not made to add  information to visualization thus low data to ink ratio. Fourth, grid lines and tick marks on the y-axis is missing. Finally, labels and titles can be made more informative. 

### Redesign process

First, pencil-paper sketch of the graph. 

![Sketch](F:/linux_windows/onlinecourses/udacity/introductiontodatavisualization/uda-intro-vis/figures/sketch.png "Sketch of the redesign image")

Next, the visualization is done in dimple.js and can be accessed through following links. 

The visual clutter is removed like unnecessary colors. Next, informative labels and grid lines are added.  

Furthermore, the graphics is replotted with ggplot2 and plot.ly. The graphics can be viewed by following the link [Redesigned figure](https://plot.ly/~rrahul/57)
