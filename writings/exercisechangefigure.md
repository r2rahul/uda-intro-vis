The following figure is selected from `http://shinyapps.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/`


I would like to change following things in the above figure:

+ Remove background colour, since it does not add any information to visualization
+ Change colour of grid lines from black to grey.
+ Change grid lines from dashed to regular line. Since, dashed lines are adding unnecessary negative spaces, without adding any new information. 
+ Increase the thickness of line.
+ Colour code the points to highlight transition years.
+ Remove the description of graph (Not sure though.).
+ Add label to x-axis and tick marks on each axis.

The source codes are available on GitHub: https://github.com/r2rahul/uda-intro-vis.git

This is the revised figure.
