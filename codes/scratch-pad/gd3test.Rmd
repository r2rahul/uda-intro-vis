This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(d3Network)
Source <- c("A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C", "D")
Target <- c("B", "C", "D", "J", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I")
NetworkData <- data.frame(Source, Target)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, results='asis',iframe = FALSE}
d3SimpleNetwork(NetworkData, width = 400, height = 250,
                textColour = "#D95F0E", linkColour = "#FEC44F",
                nodeColour = "#D95F0E", opacity = 0.9,
                charge = -50, fontsize = 12)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
